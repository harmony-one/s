2024-02-04 Sun: Further work on social media oauth.

2024-02-03 Sat: Worked on social media oauth.

2024-02-02 Fri: Further work on 1wallet, burner wallets, candidate interview.

2024-02-01 Thu: Further work on social geo game app: added scripts to create a database in local storage, send transactions to Harmony network, and sync transactions whenever device is online [repo](https://github.com/harmony-one/s/tree/main/s-game). Attended SUI event.

2024-01-31 Wed: Worked on the social geo game app. Created OTP connection page that fetches wallet address from Metamask and displays last 4 digits, connections, social bond (groups), and ENS registration page. Live working demo: [here](https://65bbe0909d7fba10443b4511--sgame-test.netlify.app/) (must be opened with desktop or any ethereum compatible wallet browser eg. Metamask mobile browser).

*Planned: Further work on Telegram bot with Julia. Research more about community projects, etc to prepare for promotion at Eth-Denver.

\
2024-01-30 Tue: Added and tested more projects (20~) to notion master list. Went over with Julia on how to build the OTP architecture for the QR code/game.

*Planned: Check-in with Julia, add further features to Telegram bot (we have basic features but I believe we still need to work on implementing wallet and setting connections for transactions, have to check with her.)

\
2024-01-29 Mon: Tested and documented ecosystem projects found through dApp radars and twitter (EzCasino, Chibi Cats Cafe, Speed Star, Crypto Royale, DappRadar, Synapse, Aragon, Coherence ONE, Defi Tower, Defira, Defimons, Galaxii, QiDao, ACryptoS, Elk Finance, Coin98, Beefy Finance, and Harmony Punks.) Sent top 3 projects summary to x.country telegram.

*Planned: Finish testing the remaining projects noted in Notion. Choose top 3 projects and announce to x.country. If finished, continue more product testing (only 150 projects were listed since Github limits search results to 5 pages. Will look for ways to display other search results, eg. check Twitter)

2024-01-15 Mon: (Holiday) Researched about sending inscriptions transactions.

2024-01-14 Sun: Further investigation on how to fix the wallet connection issue on Gnosis. (TheoF was able to fix it.)

2024-01-13 Sat: Investigated further on how to fix the wallet connection issue on Gnosis.

2024-01-12 Fri: Investigated how to setup harmony testnet on Gnosis multisig ios app. Reached out to protofire team regarding an issue I raised [here](https://github.com/safe-global/safe-singleton-factory/issues/337). Added backend connection to harmony testnet and other configuration setup such as connecting API and adding assets. Tested Sun's USDC flip.

2024-01-11 Thu: Resolved environment config issues for Gnosis safe fork, got forked app to work with Goerli testnet, investigated how to adopt harmony ONE as custom network for safe-ios. TO-DO: Will look into PRs made by protofire team for existing safe contract/safe singleton factory. (Relevant PRs: [https://github.com/safe-global/safe-singleton-factory/pull/15], [https://github.com/safe-global/safe-deployments/pull/62])

2024-01-10 Wed: Researched into Multisig wallets, and Gnosis Safe. Set-up API keys, debugged, and resolved  configurations for Harmony safe-ios fork to get it to build.

2021-01-09 Tue: Researched into Thor swap, more campaigns into airdrops, minting soulbound ERC721, Unistat, and relevant topics such as layer2 and minimla on-chain.

2021-01-08 Mon: Created [repo](https://github.com/rika97/s/tree/main/s-nft) for minting soulbound nft tokens by using ERC721 contract with Openzeppelin. Investigating changes due to openzeppelin updates to make tokens burnable and making them soulbound. 

---

2021-01-07 Sun: Researched about different existing marketing campaigns using soulbound and neighboring concept (rewards for token holders).

2024-01-06 Sat: Researched more about chainflip, and how to implement soulbound tokens.

2024-01-05 Fri: PTO

2024-01-04 Thu: Researched into soulbound tokens, ERC (ethereum guidelines), deploying smart contracts and different "accomplishments" such as airdrop, and researched more into deploying swaps on chainflip.

2024-01-03 Wed: Implemented and updated [single swap protocol](https://github.com/rika97/s/blob/main/s_swap/contracts/SingleSwap.sol) using Uniswap V3. In order to swap ERC20 to native token like $ONE, need to implement an intermediary. Researched UniswapX and bridging for cross-chain swap.

2024-01-02 Tue: Started investigation into how to mint Soulbound NFT, looked into defi recap reading, and researched minimal-on-chain for intent-based applications (Uniswap, Anoma, Chainflip). Currently minimal uniswap prototype still in progress - will push progress so far after cleaning code.

2024-01-01 Mon: Sunday continued, further investigation on how to create a test environment to execute tests.

---

2023-12-31 Sun: Continued following along solidity tutorial, scrapped previous demo code and started work on implementing uniswap prototype - figuring how to write a smart contract to execute swap on V3.

2023-12-30 Sat: Recapped fundamental understanding of blockchain and started following along this (solidity tutorial series)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umepbfKp5rI]. Also studied Harmony ONE tokens (sharding to achieve 100x lower transaction fee, ~2s transaction time).

2023-12-29 Fri: Continued research now focused on uniswap, (UNI tokens, ERC20 token swap, Uniswap liquidity pools). (Followed along this uniswap tutorial)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwMyv7CmoRs]

2023-12-28 Thu: Continued research (smart contract, liquidity pool, transaction fees (gas), bridging vs. swapping)

2023-12-27 Wed: Continued research (dApps, defi, dex, token vs coin, proof of stake vs proof of work, validator vs staking).

2023-12-26 Tue: Investigated how to implement harmony tokens to uniswap and how to integrate with other components of our app. Got very confused and was completely lost during uniswap tutorial: figured I take a step back and started learning crypto fundamentals (blockchain, nonce, hashing, ethereum and eth based tokens).

2023-12-25 Mon: Forked and implemented minimal uniswap code. In need of access to harmony testnet in order to test out contract. Currently still working on swap code.

---

2023-12-24 Sun: Further research into the frameworks needed for writing basic swap contracts, looked more into Solidity and Uniswap.

2023-12-23 Sat: Researched more into different frameworks required for conducting swaps such as dApp, Alchemy, and investigated more about Mainnet Fork.

2023-12-22 Fri: Forked "s" repo and researched into how to implement minimal uniswap using solidity and hardhat testing framework.

2023-12-21 Thu: Researched into and implemented time-based OPT (TOTP) verification by creating a counter based on epoch, implementing a secret key generator in base32, function to generate hash from base32 key, and a function to generate OTP from secret key and counter.

2023-12-20 Wed: Initialized simple file for OPT verification, read assigned papers on COQ & keyless crypto wallets, and investigated how to implement OTP.
