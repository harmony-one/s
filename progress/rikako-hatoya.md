2023-12-25 Mon: Forked and implemented minimal uniswap code. In need of access to harmony testnet in order to test out contract. Currently still working on swap code.

---

2023-12-24 Sun: Further research into the frameworks needed for writing basic swap contracts, looked more into Solidity and Uniswap.

2023-12-23 Sat: Researched more into different frameworks required for conducting swaps such as dApp, Alchemy, and investigated more about Mainnet Fork.

2023-12-22 Fri: Forked "s" repo and researched into how to implement minimal uniswap using solidity and hardhat testing framework.

2023-12-21 Thu: Researched into and implemented time-based OPT (TOTP) verification by creating a counter based on epoch, implementing a secret key generator in base32, function to generate hash from base32 key, and a function to generate OTP from secret key and counter.

2023-12-20 Wed: Initialized simple file for OPT verification, read assigned papers on COQ & keyless crypto wallets, and investigated how to implement OTP.
