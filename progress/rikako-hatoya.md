2021-01-08 Mon: Created [repo](https://github.com/rika97/s/tree/main/s-nft) for minting soulbound nft tokens by using ERC721 contract with Openzeppelin. Investigating changes due to openzeppelin updates to make tokens burnable and making them soulbound. 

---

2021-01-07 Sun: Researched about different existing marketing campaigns using soulbound and neighboring concept (rewards for token holders).

2024-01-06 Sat: Researched more about chainflip, and how to implement soulbound tokens.

2024-01-05 Fri: PTO

2024-01-04 Thu: Researched into soulbound tokens, ERC (ethereum guidelines), deploying smart contracts and different "accomplishments" such as airdrop, and researched more into deploying swaps on chainflip.

2024-01-03 Wed: Implemented and updated [single swap protocol](https://github.com/rika97/s/blob/main/s_swap/contracts/SingleSwap.sol) using Uniswap V3. In order to swap ERC20 to native token like $ONE, need to implement an intermediary. Researched UniswapX and bridging for cross-chain swap.

2024-01-02 Tue: Started investigation into how to mint Soulbound NFT, looked into defi recap reading, and researched minimal-on-chain for intent-based applications (Uniswap, Anoma, Chainflip). Currently minimal uniswap prototype still in progress - will push progress so far after cleaning code.

2024-01-01 Mon: Sunday continued, further investigation on how to create a test environment to execute tests.

---

2023-12-31 Sun: Continued following along solidity tutorial, scrapped previous demo code and started work on implementing uniswap prototype - figuring how to write a smart contract to execute swap on V3.

2023-12-30 Sat: Recapped fundamental understanding of blockchain and started following along this (solidity tutorial series)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umepbfKp5rI]. Also studied Harmony ONE tokens (sharding to achieve 100x lower transaction fee, ~2s transaction time).

2023-12-29 Fri: Continued research now focused on uniswap, (UNI tokens, ERC20 token swap, Uniswap liquidity pools). (Followed along this uniswap tutorial)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwMyv7CmoRs]

2023-12-28 Thu: Continued research (smart contract, liquidity pool, transaction fees (gas), bridging vs. swapping)

2023-12-27 Wed: Continued research (dApps, defi, dex, token vs coin, proof of stake vs proof of work, validator vs staking).

2023-12-26 Tue: Investigated how to implement harmony tokens to uniswap and how to integrate with other components of our app. Got very confused and was completely lost during uniswap tutorial: figured I take a step back and started learning crypto fundamentals (blockchain, nonce, hashing, ethereum and eth based tokens).

2023-12-25 Mon: Forked and implemented minimal uniswap code. In need of access to harmony testnet in order to test out contract. Currently still working on swap code.

---

2023-12-24 Sun: Further research into the frameworks needed for writing basic swap contracts, looked more into Solidity and Uniswap.

2023-12-23 Sat: Researched more into different frameworks required for conducting swaps such as dApp, Alchemy, and investigated more about Mainnet Fork.

2023-12-22 Fri: Forked "s" repo and researched into how to implement minimal uniswap using solidity and hardhat testing framework.

2023-12-21 Thu: Researched into and implemented time-based OPT (TOTP) verification by creating a counter based on epoch, implementing a secret key generator in base32, function to generate hash from base32 key, and a function to generate OTP from secret key and counter.

2023-12-20 Wed: Initialized simple file for OPT verification, read assigned papers on COQ & keyless crypto wallets, and investigated how to implement OTP.
