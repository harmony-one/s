2024-01-08 Mon: Implemented the priced handling logic. Binance API only provides ONE/USDT pair pricing for now so have set that as a placeholder. Will update the logic to utillize ONE/USDC pair once found.

2024-01-05 Fri: Generalized logic and refactored classes for it to be utilized for other pairs.

2024-01-04 Thu: Fixed USDC indexer logic to accurately index ERC20 transactions, fixed Harmony indexer because subscribe is not supported (workaround to fetch transactions every 5 seconds), fixed gas estimation, and added error handling for a robust flow ([PR](https://github.com/harmony-one/s/pull/6)). Will work on price estimation and DB implementaion tomorrow.

2024-01-03 Wed: Fixed up /moe to not use smart contract and bridges. Initial implementation finished with transfer from ONE on Harmony to USDC to Base (vice versa). Will work on implementing the price logic and generalizing the logic to implement for Arbitrum.

2024-01-02 Tue: Implemented usdc.country transaction logic outlined in /moe.

2023-12-29 Fri: Out of office

2023-12-28 Thu: Fixed monitor logic for the relayer. Subscribe is not supported for Harmony network, also web3js causes problem in abi decoding with hardhat environment, thus changed the logic to poll transactions every 1 second. The monitor is working as expected now.

2023-12-27 Wed: Initiated development for relayer for signature verification. Also, looking at ways to possibly implement Circle's CCTP to the bridge.

2023-12-26 Tue: Researched over Circle's cross chain transfer protocol. Built simple smart contract utilizing the protocol.

---

2023-12-24 Sun: Testnet testing the bridge transacitons. Working as expected.

2023-12-23 Sat: Generalized bridge logic to be deployed on any chains. Generalized Bridge.sol now can deposit and withdraw tokens. In need of Harmony Testnet tokens in order to deploy and test out transactions.

2023-12-22 Fri: [Developed](https://github.com/harmony-one/s/tree/bridge/s-bridge/bridge) smart contracts to facilitate the transfer of assets from Harmony to Arbitrum (ETA: Arbitrum to Harmony 12/23). [Implemented](https://github.com/harmony-one/s/tree/bridge/s-bridge/bridge) verification logic using signatures authenticated by the relayer, ensuring cross chain validation.

2023-12-21 Thu: Researched into bridge implementation and studied solidity to began smart contract development. Also researched for secure ways to authenticate transactions between different chains, mostly [signature proofs vs merkle tree](https://github.com/harmony-one/s/blob/bridge/s-bridge/bridge/README.md).
