2023-12-22 Fri: [Developed](https://github.com/harmony-one/s/tree/bridge/s-bridge/bridge) smart contracts to facilitate the transfer of assets from Harmony to Arbitrum. [Implemented](https://github.com/harmony-one/s/tree/bridge/s-bridge/bridge) verification logic using signatures authenticated by the relayer, ensuring validation cross chain.

2023-12-21 Thu: Researched into bridge implementation and studied solidity to began smart contract development. Also researched for secure ways to authenticate transactions between different chains, mostly [signature proofs vs merkle tree](https://github.com/harmony-one/s/blob/bridge/s-bridge/bridge/README.md).
